# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Disease Detection with CNN

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect plant leaf diseases from images.  
AI-driven precision agriculture helps optimize **crop yield**, **reduce pesticide use**, and improve **food security**.

## Key Features
- Classifies images of plant leaves (healthy or diseased).
- Simple CNN architecture.
- Works with many types of crops (dataset dependent).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- matplotlib

## Usage
1. Prepare or download a labeled dataset of crop leaves.
2. Organize folders as `dataset/train/<class_name>`.
3. Run `crop_disease_detection.py` to train the model.
4. Evaluate model accuracy on validation data.

## Example Output
Model accuracy: 95%  
Sample classified leaf images displayed in plot.

## Future Work
- Use advanced CNN architectures (MobileNet, ResNet).
- Build a mobile app for farmers to scan leaves.
- Integrate with IoT sensors for real-time monitoring.
